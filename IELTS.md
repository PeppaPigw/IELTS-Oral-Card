# Part1

## Advertisements

q1 Are there many advertisements in your country

Definitely, there are. To be honest, advertising is a very powerful tool, and it has become increasingly common in my country in recent years. Advertisements appear everywhere, from streets to social media, and they are often very dense. For example, in Beijing, especially in suburban areas, you can see some colorful flyers posted on street wall.

q2 Why do you think there are so many advertisements now

There are several reasons for this. One major reason is that there are now many different advertising channels available, such as social media, apps, and online platforms, which makes it much easier for companies to promote their products or services. By investing in advertising, businesses can increase their visibility and reach a wider audience, which often leads to higher sales.

q3 Have you ever bought anything because of the advertisement

Yes, I have. Some advertisements really influence my buying decisions, especially when the product looks attractive and meets my actual needs. For example, a few years ago, I saw the Apple Watch mainly as a fashion accessory. However, after watching an advertisement, I realized that it can track health data and record daily exercise very effectively. I found that feature extremely useful, so I decided to buy it. In that case, the advertisement definitely influenced my decision.

q4 Do you like advertisements

I would say I enjoy some advertisements, especially when they are creative and engaging. To be honest, I think advertising has certain benefits. For instance, it can provide financial support for technology companies and digital platforms, and even for some open-source projects, allowing them to continue developing and improving their services. As long as advertisements are not too intrusive, I believe they are acceptable and even necessary in today’s market-driven society.

No, not really. Most TV channels in my country are commercial, so they broadcast advertisements throughout the day, and sometimes there are simply too many. In addition, product placement is very common, especially in TV dramas and soap operas, where branded items are often placed right next to the actors. Even during major events, such as the Spring Festival Gala for Chinese New Year, advertisements and sponsored products are clearly visible to audiences across the whole country

q6 Do you enjoy watching adverts on TV

To be honest, it really depends. I dislike commercials that interrupt films because they completely break the flow. During primetime TV, it feels like even more adverts are squeezed in, which can be quite annoying. Celebrity endorsements also get on my nerves, as everyone knows they are mainly doing it for the money.

However, in some situations, such as when watching free online videos, I see short advertisements as a kind of break—for both the viewer and the content itself. As long as the advert is brief and placed between episodes rather than in the middle of a video, I think it’s acceptable

q7 What are the best ways for ordinary people to advertise something they want to sell in your country

Nowadays, one of the most effective ways for ordinary people to advertise something they want to sell in my country is through social media. For example, platforms like Red Note, also known as Xiaohongshu, allow users to share their daily lives as well as useful or new products. Many people promote items by posting reviews or recommendations.

In addition, some sellers cooperate with popular online influencers and ask them to try and praise their products, which can quickly attract attention. Another very common method is live-stream selling. This has become extremely popular in China, especially on short-video platforms such as TikTok, where hosts promote products in real time and interact directly with viewers.

q8 What are the different places where we see advertisements

Advertisements are everywhere in our daily lives. We can see them in many different places and through various forms of communication. For example, there are flyers and banners on the streets, as well as printed advertisements in newspapers and magazines. In addition, electronic advertisements are very common on social media and other online platforms. These advertisements can appear in different formats, such as written text, spoken messages, or short video clips.

## Age

q1 Do you like your current age

Yes, definitely. I’m very happy with my current age because I feel it has made me more mature and wiser. It feels great to be alive and to have already experienced so much of the world. I think being 22 is one of the best stages of life, because at this age we usually have a fully developed body and mind, and we are capable of handling our studies, work, and daily life.

Compared with middle-aged people, we generally have fewer pressures from the workplace or family responsibilities. We are still relatively fresh, full of energy, and free to explore the world more bravely and independently.

q2 What was the most important decision you have made

The most important decision I’ve ever made was choosing my university major. I decided to study computer science, and it’s a choice I’ve never regretted. When I was a child, I always thought programmers and hackers were really cool—they could sit in front of a computer, type quickly on a keyboard, and create amazing things using technology.

Over time, I realized that computer science allows people to build everything from software to hardware, which I find fascinating. Nowadays, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, especially large language models, the value of computer science is becoming even more obvious. Although AI can benefit everyone, I believe people with a strong technical background can make better use of these tools and gain a real advantage in their studies and future careers.

## Animals

q1 What kinds of animals do you like

I usually like small and gentle animals, especially those that are quiet and well-behaved, such as cats. I find them easy to live with because they don’t cause much trouble or damage household items.

For example, I have a British Shorthair cat at home. He’s very calm and obedient, and he rarely makes a mess. At the same time, he’s intelligent enough to understand simple instructions, like when to stay inside or move away from certain areas, which makes living with him even more comfortable

q2 Do you like to see animals in the zoo

No, I don’t really enjoy seeing animals in zoos. In fact, I often feel sorry for them. Many animals are confined to limited spaces, with very little freedom, which can negatively affect their physical and mental well-being. Over time, they may even lose some of their natural instincts, such as running freely or hunting for food.

What’s worse, some zoos fail to provide proper living conditions. I recently read news reports about certain facilities where animals—especially marine animals—were kept in unsuitable environments, with poor water quality and inadequate food. In such cases, zoos seem to focus more on making profits from ticket sales than on protecting animal welfare. For these reasons, I’m generally against keeping animals in zoos.

q3 What is the most popular animal in your country

The most popular animal in my country is the panda. This is mainly because pandas are unique to China and are seen as a national symbol. Their gentle personality and cute appearance make them popular with people of all ages.

In addition, pandas represent peace and friendship, and they are often associated with China’s culture and international image. Because of this, many people feel proud when they see pandas, and they have become one of the most recognizable and loved animals in the country.

q4 Why do some people keep pets at home

People keep pets at home for different reasons. Some simply enjoy the companionship of animals, such as keeping a cat because it’s cute, gentle, and pleasant to be around.

Others keep pets for more social reasons. For example, some people see owning rare or expensive pets as a way to show status, even if they are not genuinely passionate about animals.

As for me, I keep a British Shorthair cat because I treat him like a family member. Interacting with him helps me relax and relieve stress, which is one of the main emotional benefits of having a pet

q5 Have you ever seen wild animals before

Yes, I have. I remember visiting a grassland area when I was about twelve years old, where I saw many wild horses. They were running freely across the open fields, and when they got tired, they stopped to graze or lie in the sun. Watching them living so freely in their natural environment left a strong impression on me

q6 Which wild animals do you like the most

The wild animals I admire the most are horses. I’m not only attracted to their strong and elegant bodies or their smooth coats, but also to the way they run freely across open fields, which shows a powerful sense of beauty and freedom.

Watching them move with such strength and grace often fills me with admiration for nature and its creativity. To me, horses perfectly combine power and gentleness, which is why I find them so inspiring

## Apps

q1 What's the most popular APP in your country

The most popular app in my country is definitely TikTok. Almost everyone has it installed on their smartphone. It’s a short-video social media platform where users can upload videos to share their daily lives.

In addition, many people use it for live streaming, covering content such as outdoor adventures, video games, and product reviews. TikTok also has huge commercial value, as some users sell products directly through live-stream shopping, which has become extremely popular in recent years.

q2 What kinds of Apps do you often use

I mainly use social media apps and entertainment apps. For example, I use WeChat to stay in touch with friends and family, and I use entertainment apps like TikTok to relax in my free time. I usually go on these apps either to socialize or simply to unwind and have some fun after a busy day.

q3 Do old people in your country like to use Apps

Yes, definitely. Many older people in my country are quite open to using apps, especially older women. They find apps very useful for staying in touch with friends and family. For example, almost every older woman I know uses WeChat to communicate more easily with others.

In addition, some of them also use apps like TikTok, which helps them access information quickly and keep up with current events and trends around the world.

q4 What kinds of Apps would you like to have in the future

I'm really addicted to technology, so in the future, I’d really like to have an app that can integrate and manage all smart technologies in one place, especially for smart homes. Ideally, this app would allow users to control all their devices through a single interface instead of switching between different platforms.

Although some companies already offer smart home systems, I think they are still not intelligent enough. In the future, I imagine an app powered by artificial intelligence, where users only need to state their goals, and the AI handles the entire process automatically. The app would mainly serve as a place to give instructions and check results, while all the complex technical details are handled in the background.

q5 What was the first APP you used

The first app I ever used was WeChat. It’s a social media platform that is extremely popular in China, and it’s quite similar to apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. Through WeChat, users can chat with friends, share photos and videos, create group chats, and even make payments, which makes it very convenient for daily communication.

I still remember using WeChat when I was younger to chat with my classmates while we were doing homework. That experience left a strong impression on me and made the app an important part of my daily life.

## Arts

q1 Do you like art

Yes, definitely. I’m a big fan of art, and it plays an important role in my life. I enjoy art in many different forms, including music, architecture, literature, and cultural works. These art forms help me relax, express emotions, and see the world from different perspectives. Overall, art makes my life more meaningful and inspiring.

q2 Have you ever visited an art gallery

Yes, I have developed a strong interest in visiting art exhibitions, and since then I’ve made it a habit to explore different galleries whenever I have the chance. Through these visits, I’ve also become friends with several artists, who now invite me to their exhibitions quite regularly.

For me, art galleries are not only places to appreciate creativity, but also a way to stay informed about current trends in contemporary art. More importantly, spending time in these spaces helps me unwind and significantly reduces the stress I experience from study

q3 Is there any artwork on the wall in your room

Yes, there is. I have a piece of calligraphy hanging on the wall in my room. I wrote it myself when I was in the sixth grade of primary school, back when I spent a lot of time practicing calligraphy.

The handwriting itself isn’t particularly impressive, but it carries strong emotional value for me. When I look at it, I’m reminded of my childhood, especially the times when my mother stood beside me and strictly supervised my practice. That piece of artwork brings back many warm memories, which is why I’ve kept it on my wall.

q4 What type of art do you enjoy most

The type of art I enjoy the most is music. I believe the history of music closely reflects the history of human civilization. Although all forms of art involve the artist’s personal emotions, music, in my opinion, has the strongest emotional impact on people.

The pitch of the notes feels similar to the tone of a human voice, and the rhythm is like the pace and emotion of speech. Because of this, listening to music often feels like having a conversation with the artist. I enjoy many different genres of music, and each one feels like getting to know a different person, which is why music is so meaningful to me.

q5 Have you ever learned anything artistic

Yes, I have. I studied calligraphy at school when I was around twelve years old, although I only continued for about two years. At the time, I enjoyed the artistic side of it, but the learning process itself wasn’t very pleasant for me. The teaching was quite strict, and my parents closely supervised my practice, which made it feel more like an obligation than a hobby.

However, as I’ve grown older, my attitude has changed. Whenever I occasionally think about calligraphy or practice it again, I’m struck by its depth and cultural richness. Looking back, I’m actually grateful for the experience, because it gave me a deeper appreciation of this traditional art form.

q6 Would you prefer to create art or view art

I think I would prefer to appreciate existing art rather than create it myself. For me, art is essentially a form of communication between people. When I create art, I tend to worry about whether others will truly understand it or connect with what I’m trying to express, which creates a certain amount of pressure.

By contrast, when I experience someone else’s finished artwork, that pressure disappears. The work is already complete, and my role is simply to engage in a silent dialogue with the artist. I find this process fascinating, almost like being a detective—paying attention to small details, different forms, and subtle clues to understand the creator’s emotions and state of mind at the time. Exploring art in this way is deeply engaging and enjoyable for me.

q7 Do you think it's important for art to be taught in schools

Yes, I do think art should be taught in schools. Some forms of art are difficult to approach without guidance, so school provides a good environment for students to get a basic introduction and develop an appreciation for art.

However, I don’t think art should be assessed in the same way as academic subjects. Art is about creativity and emotional expression, and judging students’ work by fixed standards can take away its original meaning. So while teaching art is important, grading it too strictly can be counterproductive.

q8 When you were a child, which activity you like best between painting and drawing

When I was a child, I preferred drawing rather than painting because drawing felt more direct and easier for me. I only needed a pencil and a piece of paper, so I could start immediately. Painting usually requires more tools and preparation, while drawing is much simpler and more flexible. I could draw almost anywhere, even during short breaks at school, which made it more enjoyable for me at that age.

q9 Do you think children nowadays still painting or drawing

Yes, I think many children nowadays still enjoy painting and drawing. These activities allow them to express their imagination and emotions in a simple and creative way. For young children, drawing is also a natural form of play, so it feels fun rather than educational.

In addition, parents and schools often encourage children to draw or paint because it helps develop creativity and fine motor skills. That’s why these activities remain popular among children today.

## Being Alone

q1 When was the last time you were alone

The last time I was alone was about a month ago, at the beginning of the winter vacation. I stayed in my university dormitory while my three roommates went back home. Because I had internship and research commitments, I had to remain on campus by myself for about two weeks

q2 What do you like to do when you are alone

When I’m alone, I really enjoy slow, quiet routines. For example, on weekend mornings, I like to do the dishes after waking up while playing music out loud instead of using headphones. When I live with others, I usually wear headphones so I don’t disturb anyone, but when I’m by myself, I can let the music play freely. That simple freedom makes me feel relaxed and comfortable.

q3 Do you wish to have more time alone

Yes, I think I would like to have a bit more time alone, although I really enjoy spending time with my friends and family. When I’m on my own, I tend to be more self-disciplined and focused.

Interacting with others is great for brainstorming and can definitely inspire creativity and new ideas, but sometimes I need quiet, independent time to concentrate deeply and work more efficiently. That balance is what matters most to me.

q4 Is it essential to have some time alone

Yes, I believe it is essential to have some time alone. Both interacting with others and spending time by oneself are important parts of life, and they serve different purposes.

When people need companionship, emotional support, or discussion, spending time with friends and family is invaluable. However, when independent thinking, deep concentration, or focused work is required, time alone becomes indispensable. In my view, maintaining a balance between social interaction and solitude is key to both personal well-being and productivity.

## Boats

q1 Do you like going boating

Not really. I’ve been cautious about water activities since I was a child, mainly because my parents always warned me that water can be dangerous. They had seen several drowning accidents, so they encouraged me to stay away from water as much as possible. As a result, boating still makes me feel slightly anxious.

In addition, I tend to get motion sickness, so being on a boat isn’t very comfortable for me either. For these reasons, boating isn’t something I particularly enjoy

q2 Have you ever traveled by boat

Not really. I haven’t traveled by boat before, mainly because I’ve only traveled within inland areas of China. For most domestic trips, boats are simply not a common or practical option.

Compared with trains, high-speed rail, highways, or flights, traveling by boat is usually much slower, so people tend to choose more efficient forms of transport. In my view, ships are used far more for transporting goods, especially in international trade, because they are cost-effective and can carry large volumes. However, as a means of personal travel, boating is relatively uncommon.

q3 Would you like to have? Your own boat

No, I don’t think I would want to own a boat. I live in an inland city, and there aren’t any large rivers nearby where boating would be practical. Although the sea isn’t extremely far away, it’s still inconvenient to visit regularly, so even if I had a boat, I probably wouldn’t get much use out of it.

In addition, I tend to get seasick, so neither operating a boat nor simply riding on one is very comfortable for me. On top of that, owning a boat usually involves high maintenance and storage costs, which makes it even less appealing. Overall, a boat doesn’t really fit my lifestyle.

q4 Is boat trip popular in your country

No, boat trips are not very popular in my country. China has a highly developed road and rail network, so in most situations people prefer faster and more convenient forms of transport instead of traveling by boat.

In fact, boat trips in China are usually uncommon unless the journey itself is designed as a leisure or sightseeing experience. In most cases, people choose boats for the experience rather than for practical transportation

q5 Do you like boats

Although I don’t personally enjoy boat trips or spending time on boats, I do appreciate boats themselves. I find them fascinating from a technological and engineering perspective.

There are many different types of boats, whether they are designed for passenger transport, cargo shipping, or military purposes. What impresses me most is the level of human intelligence and innovation reflected in their design. The way boats combine physics, engineering, and functionality really makes me admire human creativity.

## Personal info and future

q1 What's your favorite subject or course

My favorite subject is programming, and I major in computer science. I find software development extremely exciting because it allows me to turn ideas into reality.

What I enjoy most is the entire process—from brainstorming an abstract idea, to building a small prototype, then integrating different functions and continuously debugging and improving the system. Seeing something move from a concept in my mind to a working product through actual deployment is very satisfying. That creative and problem-solving process is what makes programming my favorite course.

q2 Do you think people who major in your field can find a job easily when they graduate

Yes, definitely. I think graduates majoring in computer science generally find it relatively easy to secure a job. At the moment, computer science is one of the most in-demand fields, and there is a strong need for technical talent across many industries.

For example, sectors such as internet platforms and digital media—including short-video applications like TikTok—require large numbers of software engineers. In addition, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, areas such as large language models, deep learning, and embodied intelligence offer very promising career opportunities.

q3 Did you parents choose a secondary school for you

Yes, my parents were involved, but not in a direct way. They didn’t choose a specific secondary school for me. Instead, they chose where we lived.

In China, students are usually required to attend schools near their place of residence, especially in cities like Beijing. So in order to provide me with a better educational environment, my parents decided to move from a suburban area to downtown. As a result, I was able to attend a much better secondary school based on our new location.

q4 What are your goals for the future

In the future, I hope to work in the field of embodied intelligence. I’m particularly interested in research that combines artificial intelligence with robotics.

My long-term goal is to make intelligent robots as common as television, so that every family can have access to home robots. Ideally, these robots would be able to handle daily chores and improve people’s quality of life. I believe this kind of technology has the potential to change the way we live in a very positive way.

## Celebrities and stars

q1 Have you ever met a celebrity in your real life

No, not really. I may have seen a celebrity in public before without realizing it, but I’ve never knowingly met one.

On the one hand, I’m quite introverted and don’t go out very often. On the other hand, celebrities are usually surrounded by crowds, and I’m not the kind of person who enjoys that sort of attention. Whenever a place gets too crowded, I tend to avoid it, so meeting a celebrity has never really happened for me.

q2 Who is your favorite movie star

My favorite movie star is Yojiro Noda. He’s not only a film actor, but also a musician and the lead singer of a band, which I really admire.

Although he hasn’t appeared in many movies, his performance in Pieta in the Toilet left a deep impression on me. The film tells the story of a terminally ill man who helps and redeems a young girl suffering from despair. His acting felt very natural and emotionally powerful, and it genuinely moved me. Because of that performance, he stands out as my favorite movie star.

q3 Are international superstars popular in your country

Yes, they definitely are. International superstars are especially popular among young people in my country. Celebrities from Japan and South Korea, in particular, attract a huge following.

This is partly because of their attractive appearance, strong acting skills, and overall talent. In addition, cultural similarities make it easier for audiences to relate to them. The entertainment industries in these countries also tend to focus heavily on younger audiences, which further increases their appeal. As a result, these international stars enjoy great popularity in China.

## Clothes and accessories

q1 What's your attitude toward jewellery

I wouldn’t say I’m particularly interested in jewelry. Although I do wear two bracelets, they’re not for decoration or status. For me, they symbolize good luck and personal safety.

I know some people wear jewelry for fashion, beauty, or social recognition, but that’s not my motivation. To me, these bracelets are more like small personal charms that give me a sense of comfort and peace of mind, rather than accessories meant to attract attention

q2 What kind of jewelry you like to buy

I would prefer to buy small pieces of jewelry that carry special meaning rather than something large or luxurious. Even though some jewelry is beautifully designed and very eye-catching, I’m not particularly interested in decoration for its own sake.

What matters more to me is the personal significance behind the item. I like jewelry that reminds me of certain values, memories, or thoughts, so that whenever I look at it, it triggers something meaningful rather than just serving as an accessory.

q3 Why so many people choose to buy expensive piece of jewelry

I think there are several reasons for this. For some people, expensive jewelry is simply more visually appealing. High-quality materials and craftsmanship often make these pieces more attractive than cheaper alternatives.

Another important reason is social recognition. Wearing expensive jewelry can be a way to signal wealth, taste, or social status. In addition, some people buy luxury jewelry as a form of self-reward. Spending money on something valuable and long-lasting gives them a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment.
q4 How often do you wear jewelry
I wear jewelry every day, but only in a very simple way. I have two bracelets, and I keep them on all the time because they represent good luck and personal protection for me.
They’re very comfortable to wear and don’t feel intrusive at all. Most of the time, they’re barely noticeable and don’t attract attention, so they don’t interfere with my daily life in any way.
q5 Do you often wear shoes
Yes, of course. I wear shoes almost every day, and I enjoy different types, such as running shoes, basketball shoes, and other sports shoes. What I choose to wear usually depends on my overall outfit.
Seasonal factors also matter. For example, in summer, when the weather is hot, I tend to avoid boots and choose something lighter, like sandals or plastic slippers, because they’re more comfortable and practical.

## Hometown and transport

q1 What's your hometown famous for

My hometown is Beijing, and it’s best known for its long history and rich cultural heritage. As the capital of China for several dynasties, including the Ming and Qing dynasties, Beijing has played an important political and cultural role for hundreds of years.
What makes it especially famous is its well-preserved historical architecture. In Beijing, you can find many iconic landmarks such as the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the Temple of Heaven. These sites reflect different historical periods and give the city a unique blend of ancient culture and modern life.

q2 Is it good for young people
Yes, I definitely think it’s good for young people. Beijing is known for being open and inclusive, and it actively attracts young talent from all over the country.
It’s a city that brings together culture, education, and the arts, which gives young people access to a wide range of opportunities. Whether it’s high-quality educational resources, well-developed public
facilities, or abundant job opportunities, Beijing offers young people almost everything they need to grow both personally and professionally.

q3 What will your hometown be like in the future
I think my hometown will become even more modern in the future, with more skyscrapers to accommodate a growing population. As Beijing continues to attract young talent and technology companies, the city will develop rapidly and become increasingly high-tech.
At the same time, I believe environmental protection will remain a priority, so more green spaces will be integrated into the city despite the urban expansion.

q4 Can you tell me something about the public transport system in your hometown
Public transport in my hometown, Beijing, is very well developed and convenient. The city has an extensive road network, along with a wide coverage of buses and an efficient subway system that connects almost every area.
However, surface traffic is often heavily congested, especially during rush hours in the morning and evening. Although policies such as license-plate restrictions have been introduced, their impact on easing traffic congestion has been fairly limited.

q5 Is the traffic heavy in your city
Yes, the traffic in my city is definitely heavy, mainly because of the continuously growing population in Beijing. During rush hours in the morning and evening, congestion is particularly severe, as people commute to and from work.
At those times, not only surface transport like buses and cars but also the subway system becomes extremely crowded. However, outside peak hours during the day, traffic conditions are usually much better and more manageable.

## Housing

q1 Do you live in a house or a flat?
At the moment, I live in a university dormitory because I’m an undergraduate student. I share a room with three other students. However, when I go back home, I live in a house with my family.

q2 Which is your favorite room in your house/flat?
My favorite room in my flat is the living room. It’s quite spacious, and the sofa is placed next to the window.
In the afternoon, warm sunlight comes through the window and falls on the sofa, which creates a very comfortable atmosphere. I love sitting there with my cat, reading a book and relaxing. It’s the most peaceful and enjoyable place in my home.

q3 Do you think there is anything that should be improved in your house/flat?
Yes, I think my workspace could be improved. At the moment, my desk is quite small, and it can only accommodate a laptop and one external monitor.
I believe using multiple screens would significantly improve my work efficiency, but I’m limited by the available space. Ideally, I’d like a larger desk so I could set up additional monitors and create a more productive working environment.

q4 What kind of house do you wish to have?
Ideally, I’d like to live in a house located in the city center. Living downtown would be much more convenient, as public transport is easily accessible and there are plenty of facilities nearby, such as supermarkets, shopping malls, hospitals, and entertainment venues. It would make daily life and social activities much easier.
As for the house itself, I don’t have very strict requirements, but I’d really like to have a spacious living room. Large floor-to-ceiling windows would also be important to me, as they allow plenty of natural light and create a bright, comfortable living environment.

## Names & Traditions

q1 Does your Chinese name have any special meanings?
Yes, my Chinese name does have a special meaning. My name is Wang Qiyu. Wang is my family name, while Qiyu carries symbolic meaning.
The character “Qi” comes from Qilin, a mythical creature in Chinese culture that represents good luck and positive fortune. The character “Yu” means the universe or the vast sky, symbolizing openness and a broad horizon.
Together, my name reflects my parents’ hope that I would be lucky in life and develop a wide, open-minded perspective, much like having a broad view of the world.

q2 Do you think you’ll change your name in the future?
Definitely not. I have no intention of changing my name in the future. First of all, I truly appreciate the name my parents gave me, as it carries their expectations and care.
In addition, my name was chosen with reference to traditional Chinese beliefs, such as a person’s birth information, which gives it special cultural and symbolic meaning.
In traditional Chinese culture, changing one’s name is often seen as inappropriate or unlucky, as it may be considered disrespectful to one’s parents and cultural heritage

q3 Are there any important traditions about giving children their names in China?
Yes, absolutely. There are several important traditions related to naming children in China. First of all, every child has a family name, which is passed down through generations.
In addition, in some families, children from the same generation—such as siblings or cousins—share a generation name. In three-character names, this is usually the second character, and it is the same for everyone in that generation, which helps show family lineage and relationships.
Moreover, Chinese given names often carry positive meanings, such as good luck, intelligence, or an open-minded personality. In older generations, names sometimes reflected strong values like loyalty to the country or dedication to society. Overall, naming in China places great emphasis on symbolism, family heritage, and cultural values.

q4 Who give children their names in Chinese families?
In most Chinese families, children’s names are given by their parents or grandparents. Parents usually choose names based on their hopes for the child’s future, while grandparents may focus more on family traditions and cultural values.
In some cases, names are chosen with the help of professionals. For example, my own name was selected based on my birth information, with guidance from a Taoist practitioner. This approach is believed to bring balance and good fortune

## Sports & Exercise

q1 What sports did you play when you were a child?
When I was a child, I tried quite a few sports, but swimming was definitely my favorite. I wasn’t particularly good at it, and I could only do breaststroke.
However, what I really enjoyed wasn’t the technique, but the feeling itself. Floating in the water gave me a sense of weightlessness, almost like anti-gravity, which felt magical to me as a child. That feeling is what made swimming so memorable and enjoyable.

q2 What’re the differences between sports played by boys and sports played by girls?
There are some general differences, although they are not absolute. Boys tend to prefer sports that are more physically intense and competitive, often involving direct contact or strength, such as basketball, football, or racing. These sports usually emphasize speed, power, and physical confrontation.
Girls, on the other hand, often prefer activities that are less aggressive and more skill-based or recreational, such as jogging, volleyball, badminton, or table tennis. This may be partly related to physical differences, such as strength and endurance, but also to social expectations and personal preferences.
That said, these differences are becoming less clear today, as more people choose sports based on interest rather than gender.

q3 What’re your favorite sports now?
My favorite sport now is definitely swimming. Ever since I was a child, I’ve enjoyed being in the water, not so much for competition or technique, but for the feeling itself. Floating in water gives me a sense of weightlessness, almost like experiencing anti-gravity, which helps me completely relax.
I’m also quite lucky because my university has a large swimming pool with very good facilities. It’s extremely affordable—almost free for students—so I can go swimming whenever I have time. When I’m in the water, I enjoy drifting without thinking about anything, which is both calming and refreshing. That’s why swimming remains my favorite sport.

q4 Are there any sports you want to learn to play?
Yes, I’d really like to learn rock climbing. There’s an indoor climbing gym near where I live, with artificial walls and different types of holds, and I find the sport very appealing because it looks both challenging and exciting. It’s not just about climbing up a wall—it requires careful coordination of hands and feet, which makes it interesting to me
At the same time, rock climbing is quite physically demanding and requires strength, technique, and endurance. I don’t think I’m fully prepared yet, so I’m currently training, especially focusing on strengthening my back muscles. Once I feel more confident physically, I’d love to give it a try.

q5 Do you exercise every day?
Not really. I don’t exercise every day, but when I’m at school, I usually go to the gym about three to four times a week, often with my friends.
I’m not a big fan of cardio because I find it too exhausting. Instead, I mainly focus on strength training, especially exercises for my chest and back. I also tend to avoid leg workouts, since they leave me extremely sore and make it uncomfortable to walk for several days afterwards.

q6 Do you think it’s important to exercise every day?
I think exercise is important, but I don’t believe it’s necessary to exercise every single day. Regular physical activity is definitely good for health and well-being, but the frequency should be flexible.
The purpose of exercise is to stay healthy and enjoy the process. If someone isn’t feeling well physically, or is extremely busy with work or studies, forcing daily exercise may not be helpful. In those situations, it can be hard to stay focused, and exercise may become stressful rather than beneficial. So in my view, exercising regularly is important, but it doesn’t have to be done every day.

q7 What’s the importance of keeping fit?
I think keeping fit is important for two main reasons. First of all, it helps people maintain good physical health, but its benefits go beyond the body. Being physically healthy often has a positive impact on mental well-being, concentration, and even overall work efficiency. When your body is in good condition, your mind tends to function better as well.
Secondly, keeping fit can significantly improve a person’s confidence and quality of life. You don’t need to have a perfect body, but being physically capable and energetic makes daily activities easier and more enjoyable. When you’re fit, you can take part in different activities and enjoy food without constantly worrying about your physical condition, which makes life feel more relaxed and balanced.

q8 What’re the benefits of swimming?
Swimming has several important benefits. First of all, it’s a very relaxing and enjoyable form of exercise. It’s not highly competitive, so there’s no pressure to race against others. You can simply swim at your own pace and enjoy the movement, which makes it mentally refreshing.
In addition, swimming is an excellent form of cardio exercise. It trains the whole body while being less tiring and less stressful on the joints than activities like jogging. Finally, swimming is also a valuable life skill. It can improve a person’s ability to handle emergencies, especially when spending time in nature. Knowing how to swim could even be lifesaving in unexpected situations, such as falling into a lake or river.

q9 Do you prefer to swim in the sea or in a swimming pool?
I prefer swimming in a swimming pool rather than in the sea. Pools feel much calmer and quieter, and the water is clean and clear. They’re also not too deep, so I can easily touch the bottom, which makes me feel safe, relaxed, and at ease while swimming.
As for the sea, I’ve always been a bit cautious about it. Since I was a child, my parents warned me about the potential dangers, such as strong waves and unpredictable conditions, which made me feel slightly anxious. In addition, seawater is salty and can be uncomfortable for the eyes and mouth, so overall, I find swimming pools much more enjoyable.

## Leisure & Social

q1 Why are gardens and parks important to us? Do you often go to gardens and parks?
Gardens and parks are very important to us for several reasons. From an environmental perspective, they help improve air quality by absorbing dust and pollutants, and they also contribute to a healthier urban environment.More importantly, they allow people to connect with nature and relax mentally. Spending time in green spaces can ease stress and clear the mind, which is especially valuable in busy cities.

Personally, I don’t go to gardens or parks very often, but whenever I do, I really enjoy the experience. Being surrounded by greenery helps me slow down and feel more peaceful.

q2 What do you collect? Why do people collect things? What kind of things do kids like to collect? Is it good for kids to collect things?
Personally, I like to collect CDs. Even though I don’t actually own a CD player, I still enjoy buying them, especially limited or first-edition releases. It doesn’t really matter to me whether they’re brand new or a bit worn, because what I value is the sense of ownership and the meaning behind the collection rather than practical use.
More generally, people collect things for different reasons. Some are deeply interested in a particular topic, artist, or intellectual property, and they want to gather everything related to it. Others simply enjoy the process of searching, discovering, and gradually completing a collection, which can be very satisfying in itself.
As for children, they often like to collect items related to cartoons or animation, such as badges or small collectibles with animated characters on them. I think collecting can be good for kids, as it helps develop patience and personal interests. However, if it starts to take up too much time, money, or energy, it can become unhealthy. So overall, collecting is positive as long as it’s kept within reasonable limits.

q3 Did you like reading books when you were little? What were your favorite kinds of books? What kind of books do you like these days? Why do you like reading such books?
Yes, I really enjoyed reading when I was little. My parents strongly encouraged me to explore different cultures through books, especially foreign literature. At that time, I was particularly drawn to detective novels and science fiction, because they were imaginative and intellectually stimulating. I was also fascinated by classic literary works, such as Don Quixote by the Spanish writer Cervantes, which left a deep impression on me.
These days, my reading preferences have changed. I’m more interested in books about economics and society, such as Big Country, Big City, written by a well-known Chinese economist. These books analyze social issues and population trends in modern China. I enjoy reading them because they help me gain a broader perspective, understand how society functions, and think more clearly about future challenges. Ultimately, they help me make more informed decisions in my own life.

q4 What're your favorite public holidays? Are public holidays important to us? What do you usually do on public holidays? Who do you usually spend holidays with? How do you spend weekends?
My favorite public holiday is the Spring Festival. It’s one of the most important traditional festivals in China and a key part of our culture. What I value most about it is that it brings the whole family together to celebrate not only the passing of the year, but also family unity and togetherness.

I believe public holidays are extremely important. In modern life, people face heavy pressure from work and study, and holidays provide a valuable chance to rest, relax mentally, and reset. Having this break helps people return to their routines with a clearer mind and a more positive attitude toward future challenges.

During public holidays, I usually spend time with my family. We often stay at home, wake up a bit later, enjoy big meals together, and sometimes go shopping or watch a movie. On weekends, however, my routine is quite different. I mostly stay at home and learn things outside my university curriculum, especially topics related to technology, such as artificial intelligence and embodied intelligence. As a computer science undergraduate, I really enjoy exploring these frontier areas by watching educational videos, reading materials online, and practicing coding, which allows me to use both my hands and my mind while relaxing.

q5 Do you like parties? Do you like dancing? Have you learned how to dance? Why do so many young people like dancing today? Where do people dance in your country?
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of large parties. I prefer small, private gatherings with just a few close friends, where everyone feels comfortable being themselves. In big parties, people often exchange polite small talk, and I don’t feel that kind of interaction reflects who they really are.
As for dancing, I don’t particularly enjoy it, and I’ve never felt confident doing it. I’m not very coordinated, and after spending a lot of time strength training at the gym, my muscles have become stronger but less flexible. On top of that, I tend to feel a bit shy dancing in front of others. Although I’ve learned some basic dance moves in the past, I wouldn’t say I’m good at it.
That said, many young people today really enjoy dancing. One reason is that it’s an effective way to exercise, especially for those who don’t work out regularly. It also allows them to express emotions and relieve stress. Another reason is accessibility—dance tutorials are easy to find on social media and short-video platforms, and offline classes are often affordable.
In my country, younger people usually dance in studios or gyms, while older people often dance in public squares or parks within their communities, sometimes with music playing quite loudly. It’s become a common and lively part of daily life.

q6 Do you prefer to relax at home or hang out with friends? What do you usually do when you’re alone?
I generally prefer to relax at home rather than go out with friends. To be honest, I really enjoy spending time alone. I’m quite an introverted person, and being by myself helps me recharge and think more clearly.
When I’m alone, I like to enjoy activities without worrying about disturbing others. For example, I’ll take off my headphones and play music out loud, or watch a movie at home. I also spend time learning things I’m genuinely interested in, especially topics related to cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence or other educational courses. Being alone allows me to concentrate more deeply on what I’m doing, which helps me work more efficiently and feel more relaxed at the same time.

## Media & Technology

q1 What’re your favorite colors? Do you think colors have any special meanings? What were your favorite colors when you were a child? Are colors important to you when you choose clothing? Is there anything that has dark colors in your house? Are there any colors that you would avoid when decorating your house?
My favorite colors are black and white. They give me a sense of calm and simplicity, and they’re also very practical. Clothes in black and white are easy to match, so even if they don’t stand out, they rarely look wrong.
I don’t think colors have fixed meanings by themselves, but they definitely create impressions. For example, bright colors like yellow or red often feel energetic and lively. In Chinese culture, red is also strongly associated with happiness, celebration, and good luck. When I was a child, I was more open to brighter colors, but as I’ve grown older, I’ve gradually preferred darker and more neutral tones.
Colors are quite important to me when choosing clothes. I usually limit my outfit to no more than three or four colors, and I prefer darker shades such as black, white, dark green, dark brown, or dark blue trousers. This preference also shows in my home—many of my personal items, like my mouse, monitor, and phone case, are in dark colors.
As for decorating my house, there aren’t any colors I strictly avoid, but I’m unlikely to use colors like pink or purple. They just don’t feel very natural or comfortable for me, so I tend to stick with darker, more understated tones.

q2 How often do you use your computer? Is Internet important to our lives? What do you think of online shopping? Do you think we should trust information on the Internet?
As an undergraduate majoring in computer science, I use my computer almost every day, and in fact, I rely on it even more than my phone. It’s simply more efficient for studying, coding, and accessing information, and it allows me to do more complex tasks comfortably.
I believe the Internet is extremely important in our lives. It connects people across distances and allows us to share messages, photos, videos, and ideas with friends, family, or even the public. More importantly, it provides easy access to knowledge, such as online courses, encyclopedias, and historical or educational resources, which has greatly changed the way we learn and work.
I’m also a big fan of online shopping because of its convenience. It allows consumers to compare prices across different platforms, view detailed pictures and videos of products, and, most importantly, read reviews from other buyers. This feedback feels more reliable than simply listening to a salesperson in a physical store, since it reflects real user experiences.
However, when it comes to information on the Internet, I don’t think everything should be trusted blindly. Online information can be mixed with misinformation or even fake news, including content shared on social media or sometimes even on seemingly official platforms. That’s why I think it’s essential to develop the ability to evaluate information critically—for example, by cross-checking multiple sources, verifying dates and context, and examining the credibility of the source.

q3 Do you have a mobile phone? Which is more important to us, a mobile phone or a fax machine? Do you prefer to send text messages or to make phone calls?
Yes, I do have a mobile phone. I’ve had one since I was about six years old—it was actually a second-hand iPhone passed down from my mother. Since then, my phone has become an essential part of my daily life. I use it to search for information, communicate with friends, shop online, and relax by playing games or watching content.
Compared with a fax machine, I think mobile phones are far more important in modern life. They are much more convenient and versatile, allowing us to handle many tasks through a simple touch interface. Everything is immediate and visual, which makes communication and information access much faster and more efficient. In contrast, fax machines are outdated and have very limited use today.
As for communication, I prefer sending text messages rather than making phone calls. Text messages give me time to organize my thoughts and make sure my message is clear. They’re also less intrusive, especially when the other person might be busy, which makes them more suitable for everyday communication.

q4 Do you often read newspapers? Why? How do you get news?
To be honest, I rarely read physical newspapers nowadays. They’ve become quite uncommon in daily life, especially among young people. Instead, I usually get news through digital platforms, such as news apps, social media, and short-video platforms, which are faster and more convenient.
In addition, I have a more personalized way of following the news. I built a simple website that aggregates information from multiple news sources and helps me browse daily news more efficiently. I also use basic artificial intelligence tools to organize and analyze the content, which allows me to understand current events more systematically. Overall, I find digital and customized sources much more suitable than traditional newspapers.

q5 What’s your favorite type of TV show? Did you watch much TV when you were a kid?
My favorite type of TV show is news interview programs. I really enjoy watching interviews with successful people, such as business leaders or professionals working in cutting-edge technological fields. Through their conversations, I can learn from their experiences and perspectives, which may help me make better decisions in my own future. I also find it interesting to see their more personal side, because it reminds me that even highly successful people share ordinary habits and moments just like everyone else.
However, when I was a child, my preferences were quite different. I mainly watched entertainment and variety shows, where celebrities gathered to play games and complete challenges. I especially enjoyed the lively atmosphere and the sense of competition, which made those programs fun and engaging for me at that age.

q6 Do you like watching advertisements? Why do we need advertisements? What’s your favorite kind of advertisement?
I wouldn’t say I truly enjoy watching advertisements, but there are certain ones that I genuinely appreciate. For example, promotional videos for art galleries or advertisements from leading technology brands often go beyond simple commercial purposes. They focus more on creativity, aesthetics, and storytelling, which I find engaging.
I think advertisements are necessary for several reasons. For companies, advertising helps increase visibility and awareness of their products, which can eventually lead to higher sales. From a consumer’s perspective, advertisements also provide useful information and help people compare different options. Beyond that, advertising revenue can support technology companies, digital platforms, and even open-source projects, allowing them to develop more smoothly and sustainably.
As for my personal preference, I’m most drawn to advertisements related to technology or artistic design. These kinds of ads tend to combine innovation with visual appeal, making them more inspiring than purely sales-driven commercials.

## Nature & Science

q1 Why do people prefer to stay away from noise? What’s your favorite kind of sound? What kind of sound do you try to avoid?
People generally prefer to stay away from noise for both physical and psychological reasons. From a scientific perspective, excessive noise can increase heart rate, raise stress levels, and even damage hearing over time. Mentally, constant noise can cause anxiety and make it difficult for people to relax or think clearly.
In addition, noise often interferes with concentration. Whether someone is working, studying, or simply trying to rest, loud or irregular sounds can reduce efficiency and negatively affect daily life.
As for me, my favorite kinds of sounds are natural ones, such as the sound of rain, ocean waves, or wind. These sounds are gentle and rhythmic, which makes me feel calm, clear-minded, and open to thinking. On the other hand, I try to avoid sounds that are too loud, harsh, or chaotic, as they feel overwhelming and disturb my sense of balance.

q2 What’re your favorite wild animals? Why do some people keep pets? Do birds have any special meanings in China? Do you think it is important to protect birds?
My favorite wild animals are horses. I admire them because they are strong, elegant, and full of energy. Watching horses run freely across grasslands is incredibly impressive to me. Their powerful movement and graceful posture reflect a kind of natural beauty that feels both aesthetic and inspiring.
People keep pets for several reasons. For many young people who live alone, pets provide companionship and help reduce feelings of loneliness and stress. Pets are often treated as family members—they’re cute, emotionally responsive, and can offer comfort through daily interaction, much like caring for a child in a simpler form.
Birds do carry special meanings in Chinese culture. For example, magpies are seen as symbols of good luck and happiness, because their name is associated with joyful events. On the other hand, some birds like crows are traditionally viewed more negatively, often linked to misfortune, largely due to cultural symbolism and color associations.
I strongly believe it’s important to protect birds. Ecologically, birds play a vital role in nature—they help control insect populations and also serve as part of the food chain for larger animals. Protecting birds helps maintain ecological balance and biodiversity, which is essential for a sustainable natural environment.

q3 Do you think science is important to our lives? Why? Which kind of technology are you most interested in?
Yes, I absolutely think science is essential to our lives. Science helps us understand how the world works, from the laws of nature to how the human body functions. More importantly, scientific knowledge allows us to make better decisions and live healthier, more efficient lives.
For example, in healthcare, science helps people distinguish between evidence-based medicine and unproven or misleading treatments. Some older people may rely on traditional remedies or questionable cures, but scientific research shows that a balanced diet, proper nutrition, and modern medical treatment are far more effective. In this way, science not only explains the world but also improves our quality of life.
As for technology, the field I’m most interested in is artificial intelligence. I’m currently an undergraduate majoring in computer science, and I plan to continue my studies in this area in the future. Right now, I’m working on projects related to large language models and long-context memory, which I believe have great potential. I’m especially drawn to cutting-edge technologies that are both innovative and genuinely useful, because they can bring meaningful improvements to everyday life.

## Daily Life

q1 What kind of food is most popular in your country? What’s your favorite food?
It’s quite difficult to name a single most popular food in my country, because China is vast and regional food preferences vary a lot. Even within the same province, people can have very different diets. Generally speaking, people in northern China tend to prefer wheat-based foods, while those in the south rely more on rice.
In the north, noodles are extremely popular. There are many varieties, served with different sauces and toppings such as tomatoes, potatoes, lamb, or beef. Dumplings are also a staple there, especially during festivals. In southern China, rice dishes and rice noodles are more common and form the basis of everyday meals.
As for my personal preference, I really enjoy fried food, especially fried chicken wings and drumsticks. I like the contrast between the crispy outer layer and the juicy meat inside—it’s very satisfying, even though I know it’s not something I should eat too often.

q2 Where do you usually buy clothing? What is your favorite kind of clothing? Do you like fashionable clothes? Do you like shopping?
I usually buy my clothes online. Nowadays, digital payment is very convenient, and online platforms make it easy to access different brands and stores. One big advantage is that I can compare prices across platforms and read reviews from other customers, which I find much more reliable than only listening to salespeople in physical shops.
In terms of style, I used to prefer sportswear, but recently I’ve become more interested in clothing that looks more refined and aesthetically pleasing. I do like fashionable clothes, but not anything too flashy or exaggerated. I prefer simple, well-designed pieces that are practical and comfortable.
As for shopping, I enjoy it, but I try to stay disciplined. To save money, I limit how often I shop and usually only buy clothes when I genuinely need them.

q3 Do you often do housework at home? Do you often make things by yourself? Is it important for kids to be skilled in handicrafts?
To be honest, I don’t do housework very often. I rely on household robots to handle tasks like sweeping the floor or cleaning windows. However, I do wash the dishes after every meal, which I see as a basic responsibility.
I enjoy DIY activities in theory, but I rarely make things myself. One reason is that the quality of handmade items is often hard to match with products available online, especially in terms of durability and precision.
That said, I do think it’s very important for children to learn handicrafts. It’s one of the best ways to develop creativity and learn through hands-on experience. Making things by themselves allows kids to face challenges, solve problems step by step, and gain a strong sense of achievement. The process itself is relaxing and rewarding, and these skills and mindsets can benefit them greatly in the long run.

## Society & Others

q1 What are the differences between the children now and the children in the past? How should young people treat elderly people?
One of the biggest differences between children today and those in the past is the learning environment. In the past, children had very limited access to information. Without the Internet or digital devices, finding knowledge depended largely on books or teachers.
Nowadays, children grow up surrounded by technology. With smartphones and the Internet, they can easily access information, learn new skills, and explore the world at a very young age. This makes learning more convenient and efficient, but it also means children may face more distractions and rely heavily on technology.
As for how young people should treat the elderly, I believe respect is essential. Older people have more life experience, and there’s a lot young people can learn from them. In Chinese culture, respecting and caring for elderly family members is considered a moral duty, and it’s even protected by law.
Beyond responsibility, young people should see elderly people not only as someone to care for, but also as valuable teachers. Their experiences and perspectives can offer guidance and wisdom that younger generations may not yet have.

q2 Where do you meet new people? Where did people meet new people in the past? Have your neighbors help you with anything? Do you prefer to have old people or young people as your neighbors?
I’m quite an introverted person, so I usually meet new people through structured settings, such as classes or clubs. For example, when I work on group projects, I often choose new teammates instead of sticking with the same people. That gives me opportunities to communicate more and gradually build connections. I also meet people through clubs, such as running clubs. Running together makes it easy to chat before or after training, which feels natural and helps friendships develop.\
In the past, people mainly met new people through similar channels, such as schools, workplaces, or community activities. However, without the Internet, social circles were more limited and interactions were often confined to face-to-face events or local communities.
Yes, my neighbors have helped me before. When my parents were busy and I was staying at my university dormitory, our neighbors kindly helped take care of our cat by feeding it and looking after it. I really appreciated their support.
As for neighbors, I personally prefer having young people living nearby. Being from the same generation, we tend to share similar interests and topics, which makes communication easier and more relaxed. Of course, I respect people of all ages, but I sometimes feel a bit nervous talking to much older neighbors, so I naturally feel more comfortable around younger ones.

q3 Do you prefer to celebrate your birthday with your family members or your friends? How do children celebrate their birthday in China? What age is the most valued age in China?
I prefer to celebrate my birthday with my family. It’s been a tradition since I was a child. On my birthday, my family usually gets together to celebrate not only the passing of another year, but also personal growth and family unity. Sometimes I’ll have a meal with close friends before my birthday, but on the actual day, I prefer to spend it with my family.

Children in China celebrate their birthdays in different ways. Some celebrate at home with their families, enjoying a big meal and sharing a birthday cake, which may be homemade or bought from a bakery. Others might go to parks, shopping malls, or entertainment centers to celebrate with friends.

As for the most valued age in China, I think 18 is especially significant. Turning 18 represents adulthood and responsibility

q4 Do you think families should eat dinner together? How often do you go to restaurants with your family members? Why are family and friends important to us?
Yes, I strongly believe that families should eat dinner together whenever possible. During the day, parents are often busy with work, while children may be studying, staying at home, or spending time with friends. As a result, family members don’t get many chances to communicate. Dinner time becomes the most valuable opportunity for the family to come together, talk, and reconnect. Whether the meal is at home or in a restaurant doesn’t really matter—the key point is spending time together.

I don’t go to restaurants with my family very often, probably about twice a month. Most of the time, we prefer having small family meals at home, which feels more relaxed and personal.

I think family and friends are extremely important to us because they form the core of our social life. They provide emotional support, understanding, and a sense of belonging. In everyday life, it’s through our relationships with family and friends that we learn how to communicate, care for others, and understand ourselves better. In many ways, they shape who we are and how we experience the world.

## Cities & Buildings

q1 Describe a beautiful garden / park.
I’d like to describe a small park near my home. It’s not a large or famous park, and it doesn’t have any spectacular landscapes. In fact, it’s quite simple, with grass, a few flower beds, tall trees, and a small lake.

However, what makes it special to me is its location. It’s like a precious green ribbon in the middle of a busy urban area. Living in the city, it gives me a rare opportunity to stay connected with nature in my everyday life.

I especially enjoy visiting the park in the late afternoon, when the sunlight turns a warm golden yellow. The atmosphere becomes very peaceful and calming. Sometimes I sit quietly and watch fish swimming in the lake, or birds resting on the trees and basking in the sun.

Even though the park may not be visually impressive, it helps me relax, clear my mind, and escape the noise of city life for a while. To me, that sense of calm and balance is what truly makes it a beautiful park.
q2 Describe a place that is close to water.
Living in an inland city, I don’t have easy access to the sea, but there are several lakes near my hometown. I’d like to describe a small park close to my home that is built around a lake.

It’s not a large or famous park, and it doesn’t have any dramatic scenery. The layout is quite simple, with grass, a few flower beds, tall trees, and a quiet lake at the center. The water isn’t deep, but it’s clear enough to see fish swimming slowly beneath the surface.

What makes this place special to me is how the water changes the atmosphere of the entire park. Surrounded by busy city life, the lake acts like a natural buffer, making the environment feel calmer and cooler. It’s like a small piece of nature preserved within the city.

I especially enjoy visiting in the late afternoon, when the sunlight reflects softly on the surface of the water and turns everything a warm golden color. I often sit by the lake, watching the fish move through the water or birds resting nearby, sometimes even dipping down to drink.

Although the park isn’t visually impressive, the presence of water gives it a peaceful and balanced feeling. Being near the lake helps me relax, clear my mind, and temporarily forget the noise and pressure of urban life. For me, that quiet connection with water is what makes this place truly special.
q3 Describe an interesting public place.
I’d like to describe a small public park near my home, which I find quite interesting despite its simple appearance. It’s not a famous landmark or a large park, but it’s open to everyone and plays an important role in daily urban life.

The park is built around a small lake and includes grass, flower beds, and tall trees. What makes it interesting as a public place is how people use it. You can see elderly people taking slow walks, parents spending time with their children, and young people sitting quietly by the water or chatting with friends.

Because it’s located in a busy city area, the park acts as a shared space where people can slow down and take a break from their routines. I especially enjoy going there in the late afternoon, when the sunlight reflects on the lake and creates a calm, golden atmosphere. The presence of water and greenery makes the space feel peaceful, even though it’s surrounded by traffic and buildings.

Although the park doesn’t have impressive facilities or attractions, I find it interesting because it brings different people together and offers everyone free access to nature. It’s a public place where people can relax, reflect, and feel connected—to the environment and to each other.
q4 Describe an ideal house / flat.
I’d like to live in a flat located in the city center. The main reason is convenience. Living downtown means easy access to public transport and daily facilities, such as supermarkets, hospitals, and entertainment venues, which would make everyday life much easier.

In terms of space, I don’t have very high requirements. I don’t need a large apartment, but I do want a comfortable bedroom and a bright living room. Ideally, the living room would have a sofa placed near a window, and the flat would face south. That way, in the afternoon, warm golden sunlight could stream through the window. I imagine myself lying on the sofa with my cats, reading a book and completely relaxing.

I’d also like the flat to have a kitchen, because I enjoy cooking for myself. It doesn’t need to be very big, since I’m not an expert cook, but it should be functional enough for simple meals. Overall, my ideal home is not about luxury or size, but about comfort, light, and a peaceful atmosphere in the middle of a busy city.
q5 Describe a flat / house / room you lived in when you were a child.
’d like to describe a flat that I lived in during my childhood. It was located in a suburban area, so transportation wasn’t very convenient. Although there was a bus stop right outside the residential community, the nearest subway station was quite far away.

The flat itself wasn’t very large, but it felt warm and cozy. It had two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a small living room. What made it special was the atmosphere rather than the size. My family spent a lot of time together there. We often cooked in the kitchen as a family, and on weekends we liked baking cakes and cookies together, which created many happy memories.

The living room was the center of family life. There was a very large sofa that stretched along one entire wall, and a big television placed opposite it. On weekends, we would sit together on the sofa and watch movies, which always made the space feel lively and comfortable.

As for my bedroom, it was simple but practical. It had a bed and a work desk, where I kept my laptop and monitor. That room was where I studied, relaxed, and gradually grew up. Even though the flat wasn’t luxurious, it was full of warmth, and it remains one of my most cherished childhood homes.
Q6 Describe a place you’ll travel to when you have a day off

When I have a day off, I’d love to take a short trip to a scenic area just outside the city, ideally somewhere with mountains and fresh air. I don’t want a complicated itinerary—I just want a place that feels different from my daily routine and lets my mind slow down.

I’d probably go early in the morning, take public transport as far as possible, and then walk the rest of the way. My plan is simple: do a light hike, take photos, and have a relaxed lunch. What I enjoy most is the “reset” feeling—when you’re surrounded by trees and open space, you stop thinking about deadlines and notifications. I also like the sense of progress you get from walking: step by step, your mood becomes calmer.

For me, a day-off trip doesn’t need to be expensive or far away. As long as the environment is quiet and natural, it helps me recharge and return to school with more energy and a clearer mind.

Q7 Describe a journey that was longer than expected

One journey that was much longer than expected happened when I was a child. My family planned to visit a grassland area, and I was extremely excited because I wanted to see horses running freely in the open fields.

However, the trip took far longer than we had planned. We left early, but the roads became congested, and later we ran into road construction, so traffic moved at a crawling pace. At first, I didn’t mind, because I was curious and kept looking out of the window. But after several hours, everyone became tired and a little impatient. We had to stop more than once for a break, and even simple things like buying snacks took time because the service areas were crowded.

But when we finally arrived, it felt completely worth it. Seeing wild horses running across the grassland made me forget the delay. That journey taught me a useful lesson: long trips can be unpredictable, so it’s better to plan with extra time—and keep a calm mindset when things don’t go perfectly.

Q8 Describe a peaceful / quiet place

A peaceful place I really like is my university library. It’s not “exciting” in the typical sense, but it has a calm atmosphere that immediately helps me settle down.

The moment I enter, everything becomes quieter—the lighting is soft, people speak in whispers, and even footsteps sound gentle. I usually choose a seat near a window, because natural light makes the space feel warm and stable. What I like most is that the library creates a kind of “focus zone.” When I’m there, I stop scrolling on my phone and I can think more deeply, whether I’m reading or working on assignments.

To me, the library is peaceful because it protects my attention. It’s like a mental shelter in a busy city. Whenever I feel stressed or distracted, spending an hour there helps me calm down, clear my head, and feel in control again.

Q9 Describe a building in your school

One important building in my school is the library, and it’s probably the building I use most often. It’s not just a place to borrow books—it’s more like the academic center of campus life.

Inside, it has different zones for different needs: quiet areas for deep concentration, group rooms for discussions, and open spaces where students can read or work casually. I especially like the seats near the windows, because the natural light makes the environment comfortable. The design also feels student-friendly: clear signs, plenty of charging points, and a layout that makes it easy to find a quiet corner.

This building matters to me because it supports my learning style. When I study in my dorm, it’s easy to get distracted, but the library pushes me into a focused mindset. If I had to choose one building that represents “school life,” it would definitely be the library.

Q10 Describe some changes in your hometown

My hometown is Beijing, and it has changed a lot over the years. The most obvious change is how much more modern and developed it has become. New buildings appear constantly, and many areas that used to feel “old” now look much more updated and organized.

Transport has also improved dramatically. The subway network has expanded, and it’s easier to reach different parts of the city than before. At the same time, the downside is that the city feels more crowded. As the population grows and more people move in for education and jobs, traffic congestion during rush hours has become more serious.

Another change is the focus on urban planning and the environment. You can see more green spaces, better public facilities, and more attention to creating a livable city. Overall, Beijing is becoming more efficient and modern, but it’s also more competitive and fast-paced than it used to be.

Q11 Describe a street/road and some buildings on this street

I’d like to describe a street near where people live and study in my city. It isn’t a tourist street, but it feels lively in an everyday way. The road is lined with trees, and it becomes especially pleasant in the late afternoon when the light turns warm.

Along this street, you can find very practical buildings: convenience stores, small restaurants, a pharmacy, and a few cafés. There’s also usually a bus stop nearby, which makes the area feel connected and accessible. What I like is the mix of functions—people can grab a quick meal, buy daily necessities, or just sit down and take a break.

This street feels meaningful to me because it represents “real city life.” It’s not designed for show; it’s designed for living. When I walk there, I can observe different kinds of people and daily routines, and it gives me a strong sense of community and normalcy.

Q12 Describe a modern building

A modern building that impressed me is a contemporary art gallery I visited. The building was funded by a wealthy sponsor, and its design looks very bold and minimalist. From the outside, it uses clean lines and modern materials like glass and concrete, so it feels futuristic rather than traditional.

What I love about the interior is the use of space and light. The rooms are carefully arranged so visitors naturally move from one area to another, and there are open sections that feel quiet and almost “museum-like.” The lighting is designed to highlight artworks without feeling harsh. Even if you don’t understand every artwork, the building itself creates a strong sense of atmosphere.

To me, this building is modern not just because of its appearance, but because it reflects modern thinking: it encourages reflection, experimentation, and new ways of seeing the world.

Q13 Describe a museum or an art gallery

I’d like to talk about a contemporary art gallery I visited that left a strong impression on me. It wasn’t crowded, which made the experience much more immersive. The gallery had a calm, quiet atmosphere that encouraged people to slow down and observe carefully.

Inside, the artworks were quite avant-garde—some were paintings, some were installations, and some used multimedia. What I enjoyed most was not “getting the right answer,” but trying to interpret the details and imagine what the artist wanted to express. It felt like a silent conversation between the artwork and the viewer.

This kind of place is meaningful to me because it gives me a mental break from daily pressure. When I’m surrounded by art and quiet space, my mind becomes calmer and more focused. After visiting, I usually feel refreshed, as if I’ve returned to my life with a cleaner perspective.

## People & Organizations

q1 Describe a person you’ve learned from / helped you study

I’d like to talk about my high school chemistry teacher, who helped me a lot academically and mentally. Chemistry was never my strongest subject, and for a long time I thought I was simply “not a science person.” What made him special was that he never let me accept that label.

Instead of criticizing my mistakes, he gave me responsibility. After mock exams, he sometimes asked me to stand up and explain certain questions to the class. At first I was terrified, because I wasn’t confident. But he insisted that I could do it, and he guided me step by step—how to organize my explanation, how to check assumptions, and how to stay calm under pressure. Surprisingly, once I started teaching others, I understood the logic much more deeply myself.

He also had a great sense of humor. Even when we were under exam pressure, he would tell a quick joke and the whole classroom would relax. Looking back, what I learned from him wasn’t only chemistry. I learned confidence, communication, and the idea that effort plus good guidance can completely change what you think you’re capable of.

q2 Describe one of your friends / neighbors

I’d like to describe a close friend of mine called Jiang Haozheng. We became friends mainly through going to the gym together. I’m not naturally disciplined, so having someone consistent beside me made a huge difference.

He’s very motivated and, honestly, more gifted than I am. He built visible muscle much faster, but he never showed off. Instead, he encouraged me in a practical way. When we train, we rotate equipment, help each other adjust the weights, and most importantly, we spot each other to avoid injuries. That sounds simple, but it creates trust—you feel someone is watching your back, literally.

What I appreciate most is his “quiet supervision.” If I skip training, he doesn’t lecture me, but he’ll message me like, “Same time tomorrow?” That small pressure keeps me accountable. Without him, I probably wouldn’t have kept the habit for long.

He’s the kind of friend who helps you improve without making you feel judged. And for me, that’s the most valuable kind of friendship.

q3 Describe a teacher who taught you before

I’d like to describe my high school chemistry teacher again, but from a different angle—his teaching style. What impressed me was how he made a difficult subject feel approachable.

He wasn’t the type who only gave answers. He trained us to think. If we made a mistake, he wouldn’t immediately correct it; he would ask questions that guided us back to the key principles, like reaction patterns or conservation ideas. That method made the learning process active, not passive.

He also created a relaxed classroom environment. He used humor at the right moments, especially when students were nervous about exams. That balance—serious about knowledge, but gentle about emotions—made students more willing to participate.

For me personally, he changed my mindset. I used to think “talent” mattered most, but he showed me that confidence can be built through small wins and consistent feedback. Even now, as a computer science student, I still use his approach: break problems down, test assumptions, and don’t panic when the first attempt fails.

q4 Describe a leader you admire / a successful person

A successful person I truly admire is Steve Jobs. I know he was controversial in some ways, but I strongly respect his obsession with excellence and his refusal to accept ordinary solutions.

What I admire most is his focus on details and user experience. He didn’t just want technology to be powerful—he wanted it to feel intuitive and beautiful. That mindset is rare, because many people stop at “it works,” but he pushed toward “it works and it feels right.”

Recently, I saw a quote attributed to him online: the idea of respecting people who don’t want to follow the rules and are “crazy enough to think they can change the world.” It really hit me, because as a computer science student, it’s easy to get trapped in coursework and forget the bigger purpose. That quote reminded me that innovation often comes from people who are stubborn in a meaningful way.

In the future, especially if I work in AI, I want to keep that spirit: build things that are useful, human-centered, and done with real craftsmanship.

q5 Describe a successful small company

I’d like to describe a small coffee bar near my university that I think is genuinely successful, even though it’s not a famous chain. It’s a small place, not very crowded, and the prices are reasonable for students.

What makes it successful isn’t luxury—it’s atmosphere. The owner is extremely friendly and loves chatting. To be honest, I’m not even a coffee expert. I usually drink coffee simply to stay awake. But I keep going back because the place feels personal. The owner remembers regular customers, asks about our studies, and creates a warm sense of connection that you don’t get in big commercial cafés.

The shop also understands its “target audience.” It doesn’t try to be fancy; it offers simple drinks, a calm environment, and a little corner where students can sit quietly. In my opinion, that’s real business intelligence: knowing what people actually need and delivering it consistently.

So for me, it’s a successful small company because it wins through community, not marketing.

q6 Describe two people in your family

I’d like to describe my twin brother and my mother, because they represent two kinds of strength in my life.

My brother looks a lot like me, but our personalities are quite different. He’s more outgoing and has many friends. What I admire is his sense of responsibility—he’s smart, dependable, and protective. When we were in primary and middle school, we often studied together, and he naturally took the role of encouraging me when I doubted myself.

My mother has just retired, and I respect her deeply for her lifelong learning. She has this attitude of “never stop growing.” These days she studies traditional Chinese medicine and English. Every day she memorizes vocabulary and sometimes sends me messages in slightly clumsy English on WeChat, which I find both funny and admirable.

From my brother, I learn confidence and social courage. From my mother, I learn discipline and humility. Together, they’ve shaped the way I see family: not just support, but daily inspiration.

q7 Describe a person who has a healthy lifestyle

The person with the healthiest lifestyle in my life is my mother. She’s extremely consistent, and her habits are not extreme—they’re sustainable.

For example, she almost never stays up late. She tries to sleep before 11 p.m., and she takes diet seriously: less oil, less salt, and more vegetables and fruit. She also avoids habits she believes are harmful, like smoking or drinking, and even small things—she refuses to stare at her phone in the dark because she thinks it damages the eyes.

What I respect is that she doesn’t do these things to “show discipline.” It’s simply her values: she treats health as a foundation, not a luxury. And the result is obvious—she has stable energy and a calm mood, and she rarely gets sick.

Being around her has influenced me. Even though I’m a student and my schedule can be messy, she reminds me that health is not something you fix later. It’s something you protect every day.

q8 Describe the oldest person in your family

The oldest person in my family is my grandmother. She’s kind, gentle, and extremely caring. One small but meaningful habit is that she often urges me to come home from school on weekends, because she wants the family to eat together.

When I go home, she cooks a lot of delicious food, and the house immediately feels warm. But what surprises people is that she isn’t “old-fashioned” in a narrow way. She keeps learning and tries to understand what’s happening in the world. She follows news and sometimes discusses social changes with me—things like how technology is reshaping life and what young people should aim for.

I’ve learned a lot from her, not through lectures, but through her attitude. She shows that age doesn’t have to mean stopping growth. She also teaches me the value of family routines—simple things like shared meals can become emotional anchors.

To me, she represents warmth, wisdom, and a kind of quiet strength.

q9 Describe an adventurous person

An adventurous person I know is actually my mother, especially after retirement. Many people slow down at that stage, but she became more curious and brave.

She enjoys traveling and trying new experiences, and recently she even started considering bungee jumping. Honestly, that makes me a bit worried, because I naturally think about safety first. But at the same time, I respect her a lot. It takes courage to challenge fear, especially when you’re not doing it to impress anyone, but simply because you want to feel alive and free.

What makes her “adventurous” isn’t only the activity—it’s her mindset. She treats life as something to explore. She’s willing to learn, to experience, and to step outside her comfort zone.

Watching her has changed my perspective. It reminds me that adventure isn’t limited by age; it’s a choice. And it encourages me to be braver in my own way, even if my “adventure” is more about research and building new technology.

q10 Describe a person in the news / a famous person you’d like to meet

A famous person I’d love to meet—if it were possible—would be Steve Jobs. The reason is simple: I want to understand how he thought.

I’m fascinated by people who combine creativity with extreme discipline. Jobs wasn’t just a businessman; he pushed teams to polish products until they felt almost inevitable, as if they were always meant to exist. I’d like to ask him how he made decisions under uncertainty—how he chose what to build, what to remove, and what to ignore.

As a computer science student interested in AI, I also want to know how he would view today’s technology. Would he be excited by it, or would he worry that it’s becoming too complex and less human-friendly? I think he would have strong opinions about design, responsibility, and simplicity.

Meeting him wouldn’t be about celebrity. It would be about learning the mindset of someone who truly believed that technology should change everyday life—and had the courage to demand that it be done properly.

q11 Describe a person who helped you study

I’d like to mention my twin brother, because he helped me study in a very natural way when we were younger. Since we were in the same schools for primary and middle school, we often shared homework time at home.

He’s quicker at understanding concepts, but instead of making me feel slow, he explained things patiently. When I got stuck, he didn’t just give me the answer—he would show me how to approach the problem. Over time, that shaped my thinking habits. I became more systematic and less afraid of difficult questions.

What helped most was emotional support. If I failed a test, he would tell me it didn’t define my ability and that I could improve. That kind of encouragement is powerful during adolescence, when self-confidence is fragile.

Even now, I feel that his influence remains. He taught me that learning is not a competition inside a family; it’s teamwork. And that’s probably the best “study skill” I ever learned.

q12 Describe a person who is good at cooking

The best cook in my family is my father. He used to work as a chef, so he’s genuinely skilled—not just at making food taste good, but at controlling heat, timing, and seasoning.

What I admire is that he’s humble. Even though he’s already good, he still watches videos online to learn new methods, then experiments at home and lets the family “taste-test.” It becomes a fun family event, because we discuss what works and what doesn’t.

His cooking also connects the family. We often cook together—someone buys ingredients, someone washes vegetables, someone plates the food, and someone cleans up. When everyone participates, it feels lively and surprisingly relaxing.

For me, he represents a practical kind of love: not big speeches, but warm meals and consistent care. And honestly, those are the memories that stay with you.

## Jobs & Future

q1 Describe a workplace / an ideal job

My ideal job would be working as a researcher or engineer in the field of embodied intelligence, ideally in a lab that combines AI with robotics. I’m majoring in computer science, and what excites me most is turning abstract ideas into something real—something you can actually deploy and see working in the physical world.

In my ideal workplace, the environment would be highly collaborative but still allow deep focus. I imagine a team where people from different backgrounds—machine learning, mechanical engineering, and product design—work together. The lab would have the kind of facilities you need for robotics: testing areas, sensors, prototype robots, and strong computing resources for training and simulation. I’d also love a culture that values craftsmanship—meaning we don’t just chase flashy demos, but build systems that are safe, reliable, and truly useful.

What makes this job ideal for me is the sense of purpose. I want to create robots that can enter ordinary households and take care of practical chores. If technology can reduce everyday burdens, people can spend more time on family, creativity, and meaningful experiences. So to me, the “ideal job” is one that is intellectually challenging and also improves real life.

q2 Describe a job / an interesting thing you wish to do in the future

A job I genuinely want to do in the future is to work in embodied intelligence—basically, building robots that can understand the world and complete tasks in real environments. I’m fascinated by the idea that intelligence shouldn’t only exist on a screen. It should be able to act: to move, to perceive, and to help.

In practical terms, I’d like to research how robots can learn from human instructions, adapt to new situations, and operate safely in homes. The long-term goal is to make home robots as common as household appliances. Imagine a robot that can tidy rooms, prepare simple meals, assist elderly people, or handle repetitive chores. That wouldn’t just be “cool technology”; it would change the quality of daily life.

What makes this job interesting to me is the combination of creativity and problem-solving. Robotics is hard because the physical world is unpredictable. You need good algorithms, but you also need engineering discipline, safety thinking, and patience. I like that challenge. It feels like building something that matters, not just something that looks impressive.

q3 Describe a job that can make the world a better place

I believe one job that can make the world a better place is working in embodied intelligence to develop practical robots that support people in daily life. Many people think robotics is just about convenience, but I see it as a way to solve real social problems.

For example, modern society is facing aging populations and increasing pressure on caregivers. If home robots could help with simple but exhausting tasks—cleaning, lifting objects, monitoring basic safety, or assisting mobility—it would reduce stress for families and improve quality of life for elderly people. It could also support people with disabilities, allowing them to live more independently and with more dignity.

In addition, home robots could improve everyday well-being for ordinary families. If people spend less time on repetitive chores, they can invest more time in learning, family relationships, and mental health. Of course, this kind of job also comes with responsibility: robots must be safe, trustworthy, and designed ethically. But that’s exactly why I find it meaningful.

So in my view, developing helpful household robotics isn’t just a technical career—it’s a way to create social impact through technology.

q4 Future goals: your concrete academic/career plan

My future goal is to enter the field of embodied intelligence and eventually contribute to making home robots widely available. Academically, I’m currently studying computer science, and I plan to keep going—possibly pursuing a PhD—because I want a deep understanding of both theory and real-world systems.

In the next stage, I want to strengthen my foundation in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics, and gain hands-on experience with simulation and hardware. I’m especially interested in the bridge between language and action—how an AI system can understand human instructions and turn them into safe, reliable behaviors in the physical world.

In the long run, my dream is quite simple: I want robots to become normal in households, like washing machines or smartphones. They should help with chores, support elderly people, and reduce the daily burden on families. If technology can take care of the repetitive parts of life, humans can focus more on meaningful things.

That’s why I’m motivated. For me, embodied intelligence isn’t just a research direction—it’s a life project.

## Leisure & Entertainment

q1 Describe your favorite sport / an outdoor activity

My favorite sport is definitely swimming. I’ve liked it since I was a child, even though I was never the “talented” kid who swims fastest. I could only do breaststroke, but that never stopped me from enjoying it.

What I love most is the feeling of being in the water. It’s almost like experiencing anti-gravity—your body feels lighter, your thoughts slow down, and everything becomes quiet. Compared with many land sports, swimming feels less aggressive and less competitive. You can simply move at your own pace and let the rhythm calm you down.

I’m also lucky because my university has a large swimming pool with good facilities, and it’s almost free for students. Whenever I’m stressed from study or research, I go there, swim for a while, and just drift in the water without thinking too much. It’s both exercise and therapy for me, which is why it remains my favorite sport.

q2 Describe a healthy lifestyle

A healthy lifestyle I really admire is my mother’s. She is incredibly consistent, but not in an extreme way—her habits are realistic and sustainable.

For example, she rarely stays up late and almost always sleeps before 11 p.m. She also pays attention to diet: less oil, less salt, and more vegetables and fruit. She avoids harmful habits completely—no smoking, no drinking—and she’s even careful about small things, like not looking at her phone after turning off the lights because she believes it damages the eyes.

What impresses me is that she doesn’t treat health like a short-term project. For her, it’s a long-term mindset: protect your body first, and everything else becomes easier. She usually has stable energy and a calm mood, and that really shows the power of good routines. Being around her has influenced me—I might not be perfect, but I’m more aware now that health is not something you fix later; it’s something you build daily.

q3 Describe your favorite foreign film

A foreign film I really like is a Japanese movie I watched because I’m a fan of a Japanese musician-actor, 也田洋次郎. The film isn’t flashy, but it’s emotionally powerful. It tells a story about redemption—someone facing serious illness ends up helping a younger girl who has lost her memory, and through that process, both of them are changed.

What I liked most was the atmosphere. The storytelling felt quiet and human, not dramatic in a forced way. The characters weren’t perfect heroes; they were fragile and real, which made the emotional moments more convincing. I also admired the actor’s performance—subtle but impactful, the kind that stays in your mind after the movie ends.

After watching it, I found myself thinking about how people carry pain, how they heal, and how one person’s kindness can become another person’s turning point. For me, that’s the mark of a great film: it doesn’t just entertain you—it quietly reshapes the way you see life.

q4 Describe a well-known traditional story / childhood story

A childhood story that influenced me a lot is Doraemon. When I was young, I was obsessed with it—not only because it was funny, but because of the imaginative “gadgets” Doraemon pulled out of his pocket.

Each episode felt like a small lesson in creativity. A single tool could change how you travel, study, or solve daily problems. As a child, I didn’t think in terms of “technology,” but Doraemon planted the idea that tools can extend human ability. It made me curious: Why can’t we build something like that in real life?

Looking back now as a computer science student, I realize why it stayed with me. It trained my brain to imagine solutions, not just accept limitations. Even though the story is fictional, it shaped my interest in innovation and future technology. In a way, Doraemon was my first “tech inspiration,” and it still influences how I think—dream big, but also think logically about how to make dreams real.

q5 Describe an ad that helped you buy something

One advertisement that genuinely influenced me was for the Apple Watch. For a long time, I treated it as just a fashionable accessory—something nice, but not necessary.

Then I saw an ad focusing on health features, like tracking heart rate, activity levels, and exercise patterns. What changed my mind was the way it linked the product to real daily value. It wasn’t just “buy this because it looks cool”; it was “buy this because it helps you understand your body.”

At that time, I was exercising more often and trying to build better habits. The ad made me realize the watch could act like a small personal coach—giving reminders, recording data, and helping me stay consistent. Since I actually needed that kind of support, I decided to buy it.

So for me, it’s a good example of effective advertising: it didn’t push me emotionally; it showed a practical function that matched a real need in my life.

q6 Describe your favorite photo

My favorite photo is a simple one I took at home: my British Shorthair cat lying on the sofa near a window in the late afternoon. The sunlight was warm and golden, and it landed softly on the cat’s fur, making the whole scene look peaceful and almost cinematic.

What I like about this photo isn’t the “perfect composition.” It’s the feeling it captures. The room looks calm, the cat looks completely safe and relaxed, and everything seems slower than real life. Whenever I feel stressed from study or deadlines, looking at that photo immediately brings my mind back to a quieter state.

It also represents what I value most at home: comfort, simplicity, and emotional warmth. Some people take photos to show achievements, but for me, this photo is like a reminder that a good life is sometimes just a quiet afternoon, gentle sunlight, and a small companion beside you.

q7 Describe a song you often listen to / heard as a child

A song closely connected to my childhood is the Doraemon theme song. Even now, when I hear it, I immediately remember being a kid, sitting comfortably and feeling like the world was full of possibilities.

The melody is cheerful and light, but for me, it’s more than just a cartoon opening. It represents imagination and optimism. As a child, I associated it with Doraemon’s gadgets and the idea that problems can be solved creatively. That mindset stayed with me longer than I expected.

Nowadays, I don’t listen to it every day, but whenever I feel tired or pressured, I sometimes play it again. It works like a mental “reset.” It reminds me that learning and exploring should also be enjoyable, not only stressful. In a strange way, this simple childhood song still encourages me as an adult: stay curious, stay playful, and don’t let pressure kill creativity.

q8 Describe an educational TV program / quiz show

My favorite educational TV content is news interview programs, especially interviews with successful people in business or cutting-edge technology. I enjoy them because they don’t just give information—they reveal how people think.

What I learn most is decision-making. When guests describe failures, risks, and turning points, it becomes a real-life lesson in strategy and mindset. As a computer science student, I’m also curious about how tech leaders balance innovation with responsibility, especially in fast-moving fields like AI.

Another thing I like is the “human side.” These guests may look powerful, but they still have habits, weaknesses, and funny daily moments like everyone else. That makes success feel less mysterious and more achievable.

Compared with entertainment shows, this kind of program leaves me with something practical: a new perspective, a useful principle, or a warning about common mistakes. It’s like learning life skills through conversation, which is why I keep watching it.

q9 Describe your favorite website

My favorite website is actually a small website I built for myself. It aggregates news from multiple sources and helps me scan daily information more efficiently. As someone in computer science, I enjoy building tools that solve real problems in my own life.

The reason I created it is simple: online information is overwhelming, and I don’t like wasting time jumping between platforms. So I designed a clean page that collects headlines, organizes topics, and helps me get a structured overview. I also experimented with basic AI features to summarize or group similar stories, which makes the reading experience faster and more systematic.

What I love about this website is that it reflects my personality: I prefer quiet, focused learning rather than random scrolling. It also gives me a sense of control over my information diet. Instead of being pushed by algorithms, I choose what to read and how to read it. For me, that’s the best kind of technology—useful, personal, and empowering.

q10 Describe your favorite book

A book I really like these days is 《乡土中国》 (From the Soil) by Fei Xiaotong. It’s not a “fast” book, but it’s deeply insightful. Fei studied Chinese rural society through careful field research, and he explained how relationships, communities, and social structures work differently in rural areas compared with cities.

What makes it impressive is that many of the issues he analyzed decades ago still feel relevant today. When I read it, I don’t just learn facts—I learn how to think sociologically. It helps me understand why people behave differently in different environments, and why some social problems can’t be solved with simple slogans.

As a student interested in technology, this book is also a reminder: society is complex. If we build technology to “improve life,” we must understand how people actually live. That’s why I like this book—it gives me a broader horizon and a calmer, more realistic view of the world.

q11 Describe an interesting news story

One news story that really stayed in my mind was about an aquarium or wildlife facility where animals—especially marine animals—were kept in poor conditions. The report mentioned issues like unsuitable water temperature and low-quality food, and it suggested that profit was being prioritized over animal welfare.

I found it disturbing because many people visit these places believing they are educational or harmless entertainment. But if the animals are stressed, unhealthy, or living in unnatural environments, then the whole experience becomes ethically questionable.

What made the story “interesting,” in a serious way, is that it forced me to think beyond the surface. It’s not only about one facility—it reflects a bigger problem: when business incentives are strong, animal welfare can easily be ignored unless there are strict standards and public supervision.

After reading it, I felt more cautious about visiting animal shows or marine parks. It also strengthened my belief that protecting animals isn’t just emotional—it’s about responsibility, ecological balance, and the kind of society we want to build.

## Events & Experiences

q1 Describe an experience with bad weather

One experience I still remember happened when I was taking a flight to Sichuan. Before boarding, the weather suddenly turned dramatic—heavy rain, strong wind, and lightning flashing across the sky. The airport announcements kept updating the departure time, and in the end our plane was delayed for almost three hours.

At first it was frustrating, because delays make everything feel uncertain. People around me were tired and impatient, and the whole journey felt like it had started on the wrong foot. But once we finally took off, the mood changed. After the storm passed, the sky cleared, and I saw a bright rainbow through the airplane window. It was surprisingly vivid, like a calm reward after all the chaos.

That moment completely reset my mindset. And fortunately, the rest of the trip was amazing—beautiful landscapes, great food, and a much smoother schedule. Looking back, it taught me a simple lesson: bad weather can ruin your timing, but it doesn’t have to ruin your experience.

q2 Describe a walk you took with a friend

I’d like to talk about a walk I took in Guangzhou with my teammates after a software development competition. We had flown there together and spent days preparing, presenting, and answering questions from judges. It was intense—multiple rounds, tight timing, and a lot of pressure.

In the end, we won a top prize, and after the award ceremony we went for a long walk around the Pearl River, or 珠江. I still remember how light everything felt. We were excited, relieved, and honestly a bit proud. While walking, we talked about the whole journey—from the first brainstorming idea, to messy team meetings, to moments of disagreement, and finally to standing together in front of a panel of professors and presenting confidently.

What made that walk special wasn’t the scenery alone, but how our emotions changed what we saw. The sky looked unbelievably blue, and the city lights reflected on the river in a way that felt almost cinematic. That night reminded me that success isn’t only the result—it’s also the shared memory of struggling together and finally making it.

q3 Describe a sports game / match / competition you watched

To be honest, I’m not a big sports fan, so I rarely watch matches. But I remember making an exception for a football match featuring China’s U23 team against Japan. Even though I don’t fully understand every rule, I still found it exciting.

The atmosphere was the main reason. It felt meaningful because it was a rare moment when many people around me were genuinely focused on the same event, sharing the same hope. Watching it on TV, I felt strangely involved—as if the tension on the field could travel through the screen. Every attack and every save felt like it mattered.

Unfortunately, the result wasn’t great—we lost by a large score. Of course that was disappointing, but I still respected the players. It takes real mental strength to compete under pressure, especially when expectations are high. For me, the match wasn’t just about winning; it was about effort, courage, and the feeling of supporting something bigger than yourself.

q4 Describe something you succeeded in doing

One thing I’m proud of is improving my long-distance running step by step. I didn’t start as a “runner type.” In the beginning, even 5 kilometers felt difficult, and I had to fight the urge to stop halfway.

But I kept pushing gradually. After 5K became manageable, I challenged myself with a half marathon, and later I trained toward a full marathon. The most fulfilling part wasn’t the medal or the distance—it was the process of breaking my own limits. Running teaches you to negotiate with discomfort. Your body wants to quit, and your mind has to stay calm and continue.

This experience gave me a stronger sense of self-control. Now, whenever I face difficulties in study or research, I remember that progress is usually not dramatic—it’s built through small, repeated effort. That mindset is the real “success” I gained from running.

q5 Describe an occasion when you co-operated with others

A memorable cooperation experience for me was building a workflow for an LLM agent with my friends. Instead of just calling APIs or using simple web tools, our goal was more ambitious: we wanted the agent to complete desktop tasks through a structured workflow—almost like a digital assistant that can plan, execute, and verify actions.

Teamwork was essential because the project had many parts. One person focused on the overall architecture, someone handled tool integration, and I worked on specific modules and also contributed code to the open-source repository. We had disagreements, of course—especially about design choices and how “automatic” the system should be—but we learned to solve conflicts by testing, measuring, and letting results speak.

What I learned most is that cooperation isn’t just dividing tasks. It’s about communication, consistent standards, and trusting each other’s strengths. When everything finally worked smoothly, it felt like we had built something bigger than what any one of us could have done alone.

q6 Describe a conversation (on the phone) that you enjoyed

A conversation I really enjoyed happened recently when I was preparing for an exam. I was stressed and overthinking, so I had a WeChat video call with my grandma at night.

What touched me was her attitude. She didn’t focus on my exam score at all. Instead, she kept asking whether I was sleeping enough, whether I was eating properly, and whether I was too tired. She told me, very calmly, that the only thing she wanted was for me to stay healthy and do my best.

That sounds simple, but it changed my mood immediately. The conversation made me feel grounded, like someone was reminding me what truly matters. After we hung up, I felt lighter and more focused. It was a small moment, but it gave me real emotional support exactly when I needed it.

q7 Describe a musical event / concert

One musical event I remember clearly is _The Phantom of the Opera_. Before going, I was actually worried because I wasn’t familiar with musicals, and I didn’t know the background story well. I thought I might feel lost.

But once it started, I was surprised by how immersive it was. The singing was powerful, and the way the performers used their voices to express emotion felt almost unreal. What I liked most is how musicals combine storytelling with music—like drama, but with a stronger emotional “push.” Even when I didn’t catch every detail, I could still understand the feelings through the music and stage design.

After watching it, I realized musicals don’t require you to be an expert. If you stay open-minded, the performance can communicate directly with your emotions. It gave me a new appreciation for art that is both technical and deeply human.

q8 Describe a wedding / special family event

A special family event I attended was my cousin sister’s wedding last year. It was a traditional Chinese-style wedding, and what stood out most was the clothing. The bride and groom wore outfits inspired by historical Chinese dramas, with an elegant, ancient style—almost like an emperor-and-empress aesthetic from a classical era.

The wedding wasn’t just beautiful; it felt meaningful. There were traditional rituals, family greetings, and a strong sense that this wasn’t only about two people—it was about two families connecting. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of family reunion. Relatives who don’t meet often were all in one place, talking, laughing, and sharing food.

For me, the most touching part was seeing how much effort everyone put into making the day warm and respectful. It reminded me why ceremonies still matter: they create memories, mark transitions, and bring people together in a way daily life rarely does.

q9 Describe something you learned recently

Something I learned recently was how to set up an agent-style automation tool that can execute scheduled workflows and run tasks through a messaging interface like Telegram. The idea is that instead of manually repeating small operations every day, you can design a workflow once and let it run reliably.

What attracted me is the practical value. As a computer science student interested in AI, I enjoy building systems that save time in real life—not just “cool demos.” While learning it, I also realized that automation requires responsibility. If a workflow runs 24/7, you need good monitoring, safe permissions, and clear boundaries, otherwise it can create problems instead of solving them.

Overall, it was a satisfying learning experience because it combined thinking and hands-on building. And it strengthened my belief that the best technology isn’t the most complicated—it’s the technology that quietly improves everyday life.

## Objects

q1 Describe your favorite clothes / school uniform

My favorite piece of clothing is actually a white T-shirt from my childhood. What makes it special is that it has my family members’ handprints printed on it, like a small “family signature.” It’s too small for me now, so I can’t wear it anymore, but I still keep it carefully and hang it in my wardrobe.

It isn’t expensive or fashionable, but it has emotional value. Every time I see it, it reminds me of a time when life was simpler and the most important thing was being together. I’m usually a practical person, and I don’t get attached to objects easily, but this T-shirt is an exception because it carries memories rather than just fabric.

If I had to describe my style, I’m generally into simple colors like black and white, so the T-shirt also matches my preference. But more than style, it represents family connection, and that’s why it remains my favorite.

q2 Describe a handicraft / something made by yourself

A “handmade” item that means a lot to me is a DIY-style family T-shirt I created when I was younger. It had handprints from my family members printed on it, so in a way, it was a small craft project that turned into something symbolic.

What I like about it is that it’s not perfect. The prints aren’t professionally designed, and the shirt isn’t “luxury,” but it’s authentic. It captures a real moment: we were together, doing something simple, and leaving a trace of that time.

Even though I can’t wear it now because it’s too small, I still keep it. For me, handicrafts are valuable when they carry meaning. This one isn’t just a product—it’s a memory you can touch, and that’s why I consider it a special handmade item.

q3 Describe something you lost

Something I once lost—and still feel a bit regretful about—was that same white family T-shirt with our handprints. During a move, I somehow misplaced it among boxes and bags, and for a while I couldn’t find it anywhere.

What made it painful wasn’t the cost, but the meaning. I’m not the kind of person who collects things, because I believe value is often something we assign subjectively. But this was different. It was like losing a small piece of childhood.

In the end, I was lucky: after a long time, I found it again in a box that had been left unopened. That experience taught me something practical—important items should be stored deliberately, not “mixed into” life. Since then, I’ve become more careful with objects that carry emotional significance.

q4 Describe an expensive thing you want to buy / had as a child

An expensive thing I’d like to buy in the future is a Tesla. The main reason is its autonomous driving technology. I know it’s still developing, but I’m fascinated by the idea that a car can assist decision-making and reduce the burden of driving.

Ironically, I used to dislike driving. I do have a driver’s license, but apart from the driving test, I almost never touched a car. To me, driving felt tiring and risky. Tesla changed my perspective because it treats driving as a technology problem—something that can be improved through intelligence, sensors, and better human-machine interaction.

So for me, it’s not only a “status” purchase. It’s more like buying a piece of future technology that could make transportation safer and more comfortable. If I can afford it one day, it would be a meaningful and exciting purchase.

q5 Describe a gift you gave or received

A gift I really liked was a Logitech GPW3 mouse that I either received or gave within my close circle. What made it memorable is that it was surprisingly practical and personal. It was very lightweight, had high DPI, and felt comfortable to hold, even though my hands are quite large.

The funny part is that it was pink, which isn’t a color I usually choose. But instead of feeling strange, I found it charming—it added a bit of personality to my desk setup. As a computer science student, I spend a lot of time coding and working on projects, so a good mouse actually improves daily life.

To me, a great gift isn’t necessarily expensive; it’s something that fits your real habits. This mouse did exactly that. Every time I use it, I’m reminded that someone understood what I needed.

q6 Describe a vehicle you wish to buy

If I could choose a vehicle to buy, I’d choose a Tesla for the same reason: intelligent driving. I’m interested in AI, and I love seeing how technology moves from research into real products that people can use.

I also like the idea that the car is updated like software. It feels closer to the “tech mindset” than traditional vehicles. And since I’m not naturally enthusiastic about driving, features like driver assistance and safety systems make the whole experience feel less stressful.

So it’s not just a dream car—it’s a dream example of how intelligent systems can change daily life.

q7 Describe a childhood toy

My favorite childhood toy was LEGO. I loved it because it was both a toy and a creative tool. You start with a pile of small, meaningless pieces, and gradually build something complete and impressive.

I especially enjoyed sets that collaborated with famous IPs—those designs looked cool, and they made me more motivated to finish the model. The process also trained my patience. Sometimes a step would go wrong, and the whole structure wouldn’t fit, so I had to go back and correct it.

What I loved most was the sense of achievement at the end. It wasn’t like buying a finished product; it was something I created through effort. Looking back, I think LEGO shaped my personality. As a computer science student today, I still enjoy building systems piece by piece, exactly like LEGO—small parts, clear structure, and a final working result.

q8 Describe something in your home that was broken or didn’t work

Something that broke at home was actually a LEGO model I had built. One day, I accidentally dropped it, and parts scattered everywhere. It felt painful because it wasn’t just a “toy”; it represented hours of work.

What I did next was surprisingly educational. I contacted the official channel and bought replacement pieces to repair it. The funny part is that the spare parts were expensive for such tiny pieces, but I still did it because I wanted the model to be complete again.

That experience reminded me that “repair” has its own value. Instead of throwing things away, fixing them teaches patience, problem-solving, and responsibility. In a way, repairing that LEGO felt like a small life lesson.

q9 Describe a piece of electronic equipment that is NOT a computer

An electronic device I really love is my AirPods. The feature I value most is noise cancellation. It gives me control over my environment, especially when the surroundings are too noisy.

Sometimes I use them to listen to music and focus, because music helps me think and relax. But interestingly, there are times when I play nothing at all—I wear them simply as earplugs. The noise reduction is so effective that it creates a quiet “bubble,” which helps me calm down and concentrate.

As someone who enjoys solitude and deep focus, this device genuinely improves my daily life. It’s small, but it changes how I experience time and attention, which is why it’s one of my favorite pieces of technology.

q10 Describe a restaurant / a small shop you often go to with family or friends

A small place I often go to is a coffee bar near my university. It isn’t popular or crowded, and the prices are quite student-friendly. The reason I keep going back is not because I’m a coffee expert—honestly, I drink coffee mainly to stay awake.

What makes the place special is the owner. He’s very talkative and friendly. Sometimes I go there just to chat for a while. It feels like a small social corner where you can relax without pressure.

I like it because it’s not commercial in an aggressive way. It’s quiet, warm, and human. For an introverted student, that kind of place is rare, and it becomes a small “comfort zone” in daily life.

q11 Describe a person who’s good at cooking

The best cook in my family is my father. He used to work as a chef, so his cooking is genuinely professional—he understands timing, heat control, and seasoning in a way ordinary people usually don’t.

What I admire most is his humility. Even though he’s already skilled, he still watches cooking videos online to learn new methods, then experiments at home and asks the family to taste-test. It becomes a fun family activity, because everyone participates and gives opinions.

His cooking also represents care. He doesn’t express love through big words; he expresses it through warm meals. For me, that’s the most reliable kind of kindness, and it makes him unforgettable.

q12 Describe a good law

A law I consider good is the one that requires adult children to support their parents. I think it reflects an important value in Chinese culture: respect and responsibility toward the older generation.

Modern life is stressful and fast, and sometimes people become so focused on their own careers that they ignore family duties. This law acts as a reminder that parents are not a “past chapter” of life—they’re still human beings who need care, especially as they age.

Of course, laws can’t create love, and family relationships are complicated. But I think this law provides a basic moral boundary and protects vulnerable elderly people. In that sense, it helps maintain social stability and fairness.

q13 Describe an old/antique thing in your family

An old item in my family is my grandmother’s reed organ, which looks a bit like a piano but sounds softer and less bright. Over the years it has become slightly damp, so the sound is a bit muffled now, but it still feels full of history.

My grandmother used to be a music teacher when she was young, so this instrument represents her 青春—her youth and her passion. Sometimes she still plays it, and she even taught me basic notes. To help me find the keys faster, she wrote numbers on some keys with a marker. It’s not “perfect,” but it makes the instrument feel even more personal.

To me, it’s not just an antique. It’s a memory machine. It carries her life story and the emotional atmosphere of an older generation.

q14 Describe a place where you usually have lunch

Most of the time, I have lunch in the university canteen. It’s convenient, affordable, and it fits a student’s schedule. I usually go with classmates, and we chat casually while eating, which is a simple but pleasant part of the day.

Sometimes, if I want a quieter lunch, I’ll choose a small spot near the library or even take food back to the dorm. As an introverted person, I enjoy having some calm time to reset, especially when my study tasks are heavy.

So my lunch place depends on my mood: if I need social energy, I eat with friends; if I need mental space, I eat somewhere quiet. Either way, lunch is like a small break that helps me continue the day.
